# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure that has a wide range of applications in combinatorics and algebra. It is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This triangle has several unique properties and applications in mathematics and computer science.

## Structure

Pascal's Triangle is typically represented as a two-dimensional array, with each row representing a level of the triangle. The first few rows look like this:

```
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
```

## Properties

1. **Symmetry**: Pascal's Triangle is symmetric. The numbers on each row mirror each other. This symmetry is a consequence of the fact that each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

2. **Binomial Coefficients**: Each number in Pascal's Triangle represents a binomial coefficient. The nth number in the mth row (0-based index) represents "m choose n," denoted as C(m, n), which is the number of ways to choose n items from a set of m distinct items.

3. **Fibonacci-like Properties**: Pascal's Triangle exhibits several properties similar to the Fibonacci sequence, including the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence itself.

## Applications

Pascal's Triangle finds applications in various fields:

- **Combinatorics**: It helps calculate combinations and probabilities, especially in situations involving permutations and combinations of items.

- **Probability Theory**: It's used in probability distributions, such as the binomial and normal distributions.

- **Algebra**: Pascal's Triangle is related to algebraic identities and polynomials, such as the binomial theorem.

- **Computer Science**: It's used in algorithms involving dynamic programming, especially for optimizing problems that can be broken down into subproblems.

## Interview Practice

In technical interviews, problems related to Pascal's Triangle often involve generating specific rows or values from the triangle. Some common interview questions related to Pascal's Triangle include:

- Generate the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.
- Calculate the value of a specific cell in Pascal's Triangle.
- Solve combinatorial problems using Pascal's Triangle.

## Getting Started

If you're practicing Pascal's Triangle problems for technical interviews, you can create solutions in your preferred programming language. Typically, you'll need to implement algorithms to generate rows or calculate values efficiently.

You can organize your solutions in this repository, and it's a good practice to include explanations and comments in your code for clarity.
