## Introduction

This Python project is an implementation of the N Queens puzzle solving algorithm. The N Queens puzzle is a classic problem in which you place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This repository provides a clear and efficient solution to the problem using Python.

## Problem Statement

The N Queens problem is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, you must find all arrangements of queens on the board where no two queens can attack each other. The solution should satisfy the following constraints:

1. No two queens share the same row.
2. No two queens share the same column.
3. No two queens share the same diagonal.

## Algorithm Overview

The solution to the N Queens problem is typically implemented using a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm recursively explores the chessboard, placing queens on valid positions, and backtracking when a solution is not possible. The key steps include:

1. Start with an empty chessboard.
2. Place queens one by one, starting from the leftmost column.
3. If a queen can be placed safely, move to the next column.
4. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous column and try different positions.
5. Repeat the process until all queens are placed or all possibilities are exhausted.

## Usage

To use this Python N Queens solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KingDavidJnr/alx-interviews.git
   cd 0x05-nqueens
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Python development environment.

3. Use the provided Python script to solve the N Queens problem:

   ```bash
   python 0-nqueens.py
   ```

   You can customize the value of N and other parameters in the script to suit your requirements.

## Implementation Details

The main components of this project include:

- `0-nqueens.py`: The Python script that implements the N Queens algorithm.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

The Python script `n_queens_solver.py` contains the implementation of the N Queens algorithm. It provides functions for solving the puzzle and displaying the solutions.

## Performance and Optimization

This implementation aims to find all possible solutions to the N Queens problem efficiently. If you encounter performance issues for larger N values, you can explore optimization techniques such as parallelization or more advanced backtracking strategies.
